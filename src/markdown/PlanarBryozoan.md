# Planar Bryozoan Model

**This simple planar bryozoan model is based on the description given in the book Theoretical Morphology the Concept and its Applications by David Raup. Raup described a simple system based on the following parameters**

---

> **Generating Curve Variables:**

> **angle:** Branching Angle

> **angleRate:** Rate of change of branching angle

> **branchLength:** Branch length before branch split

> **branchLengthRate:** Rate of change of branching length

> **branchDepth:** Number of branches
