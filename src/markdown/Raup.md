# WDT Shell Model

**The WDT shell model is based on the description given in the book Theoretical Morphology the Concept and its Applications by David Raup. Raup described a simple system based on the following parameters**

---

> **Generating Curve Variables:**

> **w:** Distance from outer edge of curve to the central axis

> **d:** Distance from inner edge of curve to the central axis

> **t:** Vertical translation of the spiral along its length

> **s:** Elliptical Shape of Shell Aperture
